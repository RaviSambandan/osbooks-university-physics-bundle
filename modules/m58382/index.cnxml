<para id="fs-id1165039275458">When discussing the Doppler effect of a moving source and a stationary observer, the only cases we considered were cases where the source was moving at speeds that were less than the speed of sound. Recall that the observed frequency for a moving source approaching a stationary observer is <m:math><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>f</m:mi><m:mtext>o</m:mtext></m:msub><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:msub><m:mi>f</m:mi><m:mtext>s</m:mtext></m:msub><m:mrow><m:mo>(</m:mo><m:mrow><m:mfrac><m:mi>v</m:mi><m:mrow><m:mi>v</m:mi><m:mo>−</m:mo><m:msub><m:mi>v</m:mi><m:mtext>s</m:mtext></m:msub></m:mrow></m:mfrac></m:mrow><m:mo>)</m:mo></m:mrow><m:mo>.</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math> As the source approaches the speed of sound, the observed frequency increases. According to the equation, if the source moves at the speed of sound, the denominator is equal to zero, implying the observed frequency is infinite. If the source moves at speeds greater than the speed of sound, the observed frequency is negative.</para>
<para id="fs-id1165039308804">What could this mean? What happens when a source approaches the speed of sound? It was once argued by some scientists that such a large pressure wave would result from the constructive interference of the sound waves, that it would be impossible for a plane to exceed the speed of sound because the pressures would be great enough to destroy the airplane. But now planes routinely fly faster than the speed of sound. On July 28, 1976, Captain Eldon W. Joersz and Major George T. Morgan flew a Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird #61-7958 at 3529.60 km/h (2193.20 mi/h), which is Mach 2.85. The <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">Mach number</term> is the speed of the source divided by the speed of sound:</para>

<para id="fs-id1165039054113">What happens to the sound produced by a moving source, such as a jet airplane, that approaches or even exceeds the speed of sound?

<caption>Because of the Doppler shift, as a moving source approaches a stationary observer, the observed frequency is higher than the source frequency. The faster the source is moving, the higher the observed frequency. In this figure, the source in (b) is moving faster than the source in (a). Shown are four time steps, the first three shown as dotted lines. (c) If a source moves at the speed of sound, each successive wave interfere with the previous one and the observer observes them all at the same instant.</caption>

<title>Shock Waves and Sonic Booms</title>
<para id="fs-id1165039266222">If the source exceeds the speed of sound, no sound is received by the observer until the source has passed, so that the sounds from the approaching source are mixed with those from it when receding.

<para id="fs-id1165039349554">You may have heard of the common term ‘<term id="term-00003">sonic boom</term>.’ A common misconception is that the sonic boom occurs as the plane breaks the sound barrier; that is, accelerates to a speed higher than the speed of sound. Actually, the sonic boom occurs as the shock wave sweeps along the ground.</para>
<para id="fs-id1165035735283">An aircraft creates two shock waves, one from its nose and one from its tail (<link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_17_08_SBoomAir"/>). During television coverage of space shuttle landings, two distinct booms could often be heard. These were separated by exactly the time it would take the shuttle to pass by a point. Observers on the ground often do not see the aircraft creating the sonic boom, because it has passed by before the shock wave reaches them, as seen in the figure. If the aircraft flies close by at low altitude, pressures in the sonic boom can be destructive and break windows as well as rattle nerves. Because of how destructive sonic booms can be, supersonic flights are banned over populated areas.</para>

<para id="fs-id1165039088848">Shock waves are one example of a broader phenomenon called bow wakes. A <term id="term-00004">bow wake</term>, such as the one in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_17_08_BowDuck"/>, is created when the wave source moves faster than the wave propagation speed. Water waves spread out in circles from the point where created, and the bow wake is the familiar V-shaped wake, trailing the source. A more exotic bow wake is created when a subatomic particle travels through a medium faster than the speed of light travels in that medium. (In a vacuum, the maximum speed of light is <m:math><m:mrow><m:mi>c</m:mi><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:mn>3.00</m:mn><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:mo>×</m:mo><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:msup><m:mrow><m:mn>10</m:mn></m:mrow><m:mn>8</m:mn></m:msup><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:mtext>m/s;</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:math> in the medium of water, the speed of light is closer to 0.75<emphasis effect="italics">c</emphasis>.) If the particle creates light in its passage, that light spreads on a cone with an angle indicative of the speed of the particle, as illustrated in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_17_08_Cerenkov"/>. Such a bow wake is called <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00005">Cerenkov radiation</term> and is commonly observed in particle physics.</para>
