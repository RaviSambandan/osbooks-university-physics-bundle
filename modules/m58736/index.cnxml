<caption>This circuit shown is used to amplify small signals and power the earbud speakers attached to a cellular phone. This circuitâ€™s components include resistors, capacitors, and diodes, all of which have been covered in previous chapters, as well as transistors, which are semi-conducting devices covered in <link document="m58591">Condensed Matter Physics</link>. Circuits using similar components are found in all types of equipment and appliances you encounter in everyday life, such as alarm clocks, televisions, computers, and refrigerators.

In this chapter, we use these electric components in circuits. A circuit is a collection of electrical components connected to accomplish a specific task. <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_27_00_Amplifier"/> shows an amplifier circuit, which takes a small-amplitude signal and amplifies it to power the speakers in earbuds. Although the circuit looks complex, it actually consists of a set of series, parallel, and series-parallel circuits. The second section of this chapter covers the analysis of series and parallel circuits that consist of resistors. Later in this chapter, we introduce the basic equations and techniques to analyze any circuit, including those that are not reducible through simplifying parallel and series elements. But first, we need to understand how to power a circuit.</para>
