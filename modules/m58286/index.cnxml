Let’s assume the body is falling in a straight line perpendicular to the surface, so its motion is one-dimensional. For example, we can estimate the depth of a vertical mine shaft by dropping a rock into it and listening for the rock to hit the bottom. But “falling,” in the context of free fall, does not necessarily imply the body is moving from a greater height to a lesser height. If a ball is thrown upward, the equations of free fall apply equally to its ascent as well as its descent.</para>

<title>Gravity</title>
<para id="fs-id1168325667499">The most remarkable and unexpected fact about falling objects is that if air resistance and friction are negligible, then in a given location all objects fall toward the center of Earth with the <emphasis effect="italics">same constant acceleration</emphasis>, <emphasis effect="italics">independent of their mass</emphasis>. This experimentally determined fact is unexpected because we are so accustomed to the effects of air resistance and friction that we expect light objects to fall slower than heavy ones. Until <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00001">Galileo</term> Galilei (1564–1642) proved otherwise, people believed that a heavier object has a greater acceleration in a free fall. We now know this is not the case.

<caption>A hammer and a feather fall with the same constant acceleration if air resistance is negligible. This is a general characteristic of gravity not unique to Earth, as astronaut David R. Scott demonstrated in 1971 on the Moon, where the acceleration from gravity is only 1.67 m/s<sup>2</sup> and there is no atmosphere.</caption></figure><para id="fs-id1168328332010">In the real world, <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00002">air resistance</term> can cause a lighter object to fall slower than a heavier object of the same size. A tennis ball reaches the ground after a baseball dropped at the same time. (It might be difficult to observe the difference if the height is not large.) Air resistance opposes the motion of an object through the air, and friction between objects—such as between clothes and a laundry chute or between a stone and a pool into which it is dropped—also opposes motion between them.</para>
<para id="fs-id1168328066720">For the ideal situations of these first few chapters, an object <emphasis effect="italics">falling without air resistance or friction</emphasis> is defined to be in <term id="term-00003">free fall</term>. The force of gravity causes objects to fall toward the center of Earth. The acceleration of free-falling objects is therefore called <term id="term-00004">acceleration due to gravity</term>. Acceleration due to gravity is constant, which means we can apply the kinematic equations to any falling object where air resistance and friction are negligible. This opens to us a broad class of interesting situations.</para>

<title>One-Dimensional Motion Involving Gravity</title>
<para id="fs-id1168328298217">The best way to see the basic features of motion involving gravity is to start with the simplest situations and then progress toward more complex ones. So, we start by considering straight up-and-down motion with no air resistance or friction. These assumptions mean the velocity (if there is any) is vertical. If an object is dropped, we know the initial velocity is zero when in free fall. When the object has left contact with whatever held or threw it, the object is in free fall. When the object is thrown, it has the same initial speed in free fall as it did before it was released. When the object comes in contact with the ground or any other object, it is no longer in free fall and its acceleration of <emphasis effect="italics">g</emphasis> is no longer valid. Under these circumstances, the motion is one-dimensional and has constant acceleration of magnitude <emphasis effect="italics">g</emphasis>. We represent vertical displacement with the symbol <emphasis effect="italics">y</emphasis>.</para>
